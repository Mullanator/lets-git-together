# Let's Git Together!

Thank you for your participation! To include your nickname in the list, add it to `names.yml` as shown below and create a pull request.

```yml
names:
  - Your nickname here

- Please use exactly 2 spaces before the hyphen. Yaml is a space delimited format and spaces are relevant.
- Adding a tab will not work (and I will not accept your pull request).
